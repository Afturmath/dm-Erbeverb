## dm-Erbeverb
This is an attempt to recreate the Make Noise reverb unit called [Erbe-Verb](http://www.makenoisemusic.com/modules/erbe-verb). The reverb algorithm is invented by [Tom Erbe](http://www.soundhack.com/). The reverb design I made is based on this [article](https://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/building-the-erbe-verb-extending-the-feedback-delay-network.pdf?c=icmc;idno=bbp2372.2015.054;format=pdf) that he wrote.

## Description
I designed this mono input/stereo output reverb in Max/MSP gen~ which is a C-like coding environment within Max/MSP that compiles to C++ code. It's efficient and gives you the control to build more sophisticated audio plug-ins. Since gen~ code can be compiled as C++ code the reverb can be compiled for use on the [OWL Pedal](https://www.rebeltech.org/product/owl-pedal/), [MOD Duo](https://www.moddevices.com/) & [Pisound / MODEP](https://blokas.io/modep/). In this repository you can find the files needed to get the reverb plug-in running in [Max/MSP](./max-msp), [Ableton Live (Max For Live device)](./max-for-live) & [MODEP (LV2 plug-in)](./modep). You can see [here](./modep/src/gen_exported.cpp) what the compiled C++ code looks like.

## Goal
The goal for this project was to investigate how to design a reverb algorithm. When I first heard the Erbe-Verb I was fascinated by the sound and the flexibility the device offers to change the characteristics of the simulated space. The article helped me out a great deal in learning how to build my first nice sounding reverb. There was still a lot work to figure out by myself, because the original creator didn't share all of his secrets of course...

## Install instructions
- Max/MSP
  - open the file and start playing
- Max For Live: 
  - open the file in Ableton Live and start playing
- Pisound / MODEP:
  - Copy the LV2 folder into your Raspberry Pi:
  
    *scp -rp \<path to the dm-Erbeverb.lv2 file\> modep@172.24.1.1:/usr/local/modep/.lv2*
  - Enter the password and your ready to go
  - If you don't have permissions to write to that location, change them

  - If you want to remove the plugin:
    - Connect to your Raspberry Pi via SSH:
    
      *ssh modep@172.24.1.1*
    - Enter the password
    - Remove the plug-in
    
      *rm -r /usr/local/modep/.lv2/dm-Erbeverb.lv2*
